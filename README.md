## 🛡️ Security Research & Education Roadmap

To ensure the highest level of security for **QRMVL**, we follow a rigorous cryptographic research and validation path. For those who wish to understand the mathematical foundations and potential attack vectors of this project, we highly recommend the following curriculum on [CryptoHack](https://cryptohack.org/).

### 🧠 Why CryptoHack?
[CryptoHack](https://cryptohack.org/) is the premier hands-on platform for blockchain security researchers. It covers everything from Bitcoin Script analysis and ECDSA attacks to the latest ZK-Proofs and PQC (Post-Quantum Cryptography) preparations.

### 🧭 Recommended Learning Path for QRMVL Contributors
Following this sequence will build the necessary "cryptographic muscle" to audit and improve Bitcoin-level security protocols:

1.  **Introduction**: Master byte-level crypto, XOR, and basic modular arithmetic.
2.  **Mathematics**: Build the foundation for ZK-Proofs and Script security analysis.
3.  **RSA & Elliptic Curves**: Understand the signature structures and practical ECC attacks (e.g., ECDSA nonce leaks).
4.  **Hash Functions**: Crucial for understanding **Taproot**, **Merkle Trees**, and our **LHT** optimization.
5.  **Block Ciphers**: Essential for conceptualizing rollup compression and secure data handling.
6.  **Advanced Problems (PQC & ZK)**:
    * **Lattice Attacks**: The core thinking required for PQC security.
    * **Modular Forms & Group Theory**: Prerequisites for advanced ZK-level mathematics.

### 🛠️ Professional Security Alignment
This roadmap aligns with the challenges found in top-tier security audits and CTFs, including:
* **Paradigm CTF** / **ZK Hack**
* **Trail of Bits** Research
* **Google CTF** / **DragonCTF**

> [!TIP]
> After completing the CryptoHack challenges, we recommend exploring [HackerRangers](https://hackerrangers.com/) for broader cybersecurity training.
